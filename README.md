# Passageway Protocol Contracts

Multi chain bridge support for ERC721/1155/677

## Supported chains

- Optimism (beta)
- Arbitrum (in progress)
- Polygon (beta)

### Polygon

A rough draft of using Polygon StateSync. Contracts have been created to bridge ERC677 tokens from Ethereum -> Polygon & Polygon -> Ethereum.
Compared to L2 bridges (arb/optim) the bridging time is a fraction when coming back to Ethereum.

- 30 min (Polygon -> Ethereum Mainnet)
- 7 days (arb/optim -> Ethereum Mainnet)

Scripts being ported to foundry

### Optimism

NFT transfer from L1 -> L2 & L2 -> L1
